# cmyk-rgb_color_sensor
the aim of this project is to make a device (based on the stm32 microcontroller), which samples color from real life objects and displays the color's CMYK and rgb values on a lcd screen


## Objectives
1. write drivers for both the sensor & the display from scratch
2. create a gui for the device

## parts
1. STM32F407G-DISCOVERY microcontroller
2. Waveshare 2inch lcd module
3. color sensor (tbd)


##introduction
I decided to create this sensor due to the fact that I'm learning about embedded C, and the usecase aligns with my hobby of painting.
